# EMBEDDED-C-ARDUNIO-UNO
Braking system is an essential part of any automobile. It is used to stop at desire position or slow down whenever and where-ever driver wants. Sometimes while driving a suddenly a car comes in the way stop person suddenly came in front of vehicle, these situations are unexpected and based on driver’s expertise he/she might be able to reduce the damage to minimum. To prevent such kind of accidents and to save driver’s as well as other’s life Autonomous braking system will be helpful and can create major impact on safety as well as driving experience. So, we developed a System which can be developed further to improve efficiency, our System includes an ultrasonic system which gives the location of a particular thing in front of the vehicle which then can be compared with tables and act accordingly to the conditions mentioned. The system is controlled by the Microcontroller (Arduino UNO) which in turn controls the linear actuator to move the brake pedal. 


The main motivation of this project are: 

I. To develop an Intelligent Braking System for Automobiles 

II. To find the braking distance at various vehicle speeds as well as minimum distance before collision 

III. To instantly rescue accident victims by sending a message to the rescue team with a MEMS accelerometer GSM and GPS location. 

IV. Designing and implementing the notification mechanism for GSM 

V. Generating power to EV vehicle through Automatic breaking system
